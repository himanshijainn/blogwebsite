            <h3> Never, ever lose hope</h3>
            <p> <strong> is a disease in which some of the body’s cells grow uncontrollably and spread to other parts of
                    the body. Cancer is a genetic disease—that is, it is caused by changes to genes that control the
                    way our cells function, especially how they grow and divide.can start almost anywhere in
                    the human body, which is made up of trillions of cells. Normally,
                    human cells grow and multiply (through a process called cell division) to form new cells as the body
                    needs them. When cells grow old or become damaged, they die, and new cells take their
                    place.</strong></p>

            <h3>living with cancer: <br> am i a warrior?</h3>
            <p>Not all of us will be presented with the opportunity to look death in the face and rise up to fight. Life
                always gives you a choice. Lay down and die or stand up and fight. Fighting is not a given. It’s a
                choice. A choice to become a warrior. But we are not born warriors. Life presents challenges and
                obstacles, and we make the choice to go to war. Webster defines a warrior as a person engaged in
                struggle or conflict. But it is how that person enters into battle that makes them a true warrior.
                Rather than fighting out of obedience or allegiance, a true warrior engages in battle out of personal
                choice.</p>

                <p>i don’t like being called a ‘warrior.’ I never feel like a ‘warrior.’ When you are dealing with the
                    slogfest that is stage 4 breast cancer. It rarely feels like a massive triumph, or things that
                    ‘warriors’ are made of.</p>

                <p>I’m not a big fan of battlefield language. Maybe that’s because my cancer won’t be defeated in a
                    grand, glorious battle. To keep living, I have to live
                    with my cancer, which isn’t an external or introduced enemy, but rather a wrong turn my body took at
                    the
                    genetic level.</p>

                    I like to say I’m living with cancer. And on a good day, ‘I’m living well with
                    cancer.</p>
